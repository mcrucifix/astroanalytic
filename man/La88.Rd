\title{Spectral decomposition of orbital elements (Laskar 1988)}
\format{
A named list with two elements:
\describe{
  \item{epi}{A \code{discreteSpectrum} object containing the decomposition of
    the eccentricity term \eqn{e \sin\Pi}, where \eqn{e} is the orbital eccentricity
    and \eqn{\Pi} the longitude of perihelion.}
  \item{i2o}{A \code{discreteSpectrum} object containing the decomposition of
    the inclination term \eqn{\sin(i/2) \sin\Omega}, where \eqn{i} is the orbital
    inclination and \eqn{\Omega} the longitude of the ascending node.}
}
}
\usage{
La88
}
\description{
Discrete Fourier representations of selected orbital elements from
Laskar (1988), expressed as \code{discreteSpectrum} objects compatible
with the \pkg{gtseries} package.
}
\details{
Frequencies are expressed in radians per year. Phases are expressed in radians
and referred to epoch 2000, following the original publication. No correction
for epoch alignment has been applied.

Amplitudes were rescaled by a factor of \eqn{10^{-8}} relative to the original
tables in Laskar (1988), so that all terms are expressed in dimensionless units
consistent with \eqn{e} and \eqn{\sin(i/2)}.
